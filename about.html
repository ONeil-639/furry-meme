                    Hi. I'm a mechanical design engineer with over 20 years’ of experience working in various engineering capacities.
                    My background as a automotive master technician and later customer technical advisor for BMW; marine engineer for the Royal Navy; and mechanical design engineer for Innovative technology ltd have inform my dept of engineering knowledge. I'm fueled by my passion for understanding engineering and technology. I consider myself a 'life student,' eager to build on my practical and accademic engineering foundations through continuous learning.<br>
                    <br>

                    I have a Master’s degree (MEng) in mechanical engineering and is adept in mechanical design engineering; electromechanical engineering maintainance and automotive technology. I use SolidWorks, Siemens NX and Autodesk Inventer for 3D designs and Auto CAD for 2D modeling. <br>
                    <br>
                    My hunger for knowledge, always welcome a challenge and belief that there is a solution to every problem, have resulted in numerous successes over the years. I have a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and machine learning. I belief this is an inevitable progression in our evolution. Therefore, I recently complimented my engineering knowledge by undertaking a course in coding using Python, HTML and CSS at CodeNation.
